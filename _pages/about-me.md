I'm Antonie, a person with many interests, music and programming chief among them. I currently work as a Linux DevOps Engineer at Dutch government railway infrastructure company ProRail. I have a Mathematics undergraduate degree from Radboud University, and a minor in Musicology from Utrecht University.

Music I prefer of the early kind, that is: Baroque and Renaissance music. Everything about this period fascinates me, from the instruments ([I've copied one of them](/wahlstrom-clavichord-2020/)) and their tunings, to vocal performance practice and counterpoint rules. I'm currently in possession of a clavichord, digital piano, and an electronic organ [which I've digitalised](/organ-2018/). I sing as a bass in [Ensemble Illustre](https://www.ensemble-illustre.nl/), previously in the [Nijmegen Student Choir](https://www.nskad.nl/) and [Dutch Student Chamber Choir](https://nskk.nl/).

My programming experience ranges from low-level work with C and assembly, to general high-level application development in Python, Haskell and Go (among other languages). I've also made some games using OpenGL, and wrote a [C# gaming library](https://github.com/andykorth/Pencil.Gaming) in 2013. Otherwise my programming interests lie mostly in languages and compilers -- the interface between high- and low-level programming.

Here are some highlights from [my GitHub](https://github.com/antonijn):

  - [**cheax**](https://github.com/antonijn/cheax)

     I developed this programming language to be easily embedded into C/C++ applications. It is an interpreted Lisp dialect. Features a custom mark-and-sweep garbage collector, and on-the-fly tail call elimination.

    _Language: C_

  - [**dos-game-suite-8086**](https://github.com/antonijn/dos-game-suite-8086)

     Snake game for DOS, written in 8086 assembly.

     _Language: 8086 assembly_
