I'm Antonie, a person with many interests, music and programming chief among them. I'm currently studying Musicology at Utrecht University, having previously completed an undergraduate degree in Mathematics at Radboud University.

Music I prefer of the early kind, that is: Baroque and Renaissance music. Everything about this period fascinates me, from the instruments ([I've copied one of them](/wahlstrom-clavichord-2020/)) and their tunings, to vocal performance practice and counterpoint rules. I'm currently in possession of a clavichord, digital piano, and an electronic organ [which I've digitalised](/organ-2018/). I sing as a bass in [Ensemble Illustre](https://www.ensemble-illustre.nl/), previously in the [Nijmegen Student Choir](https://www.nskad.nl/) and [Dutch Student Chamber Choir](https://nskk.nl/).

My programming experience ranges from low-level work with C and assembly, to general high-level application development in Python, Haskell and Go (among other languages). I've also made some games using OpenGL, and wrote a [C# gaming library](https://github.com/andykorth/Pencil.Gaming) in 2013. Otherwise my programming interests lie mostly in languages and compilers.

There's a dusty pile of half-finished projects on [my GitHub](https://github.com/antonijn), where I haven't been very active for a couple of years. Some of the major ones:

  - [**cheax**](https://github.com/antonijn/cheax)

    A Lisp dialect that looks a bit like Haskell. Designed for easy interopability with C/C++.

    _Language: C_

  - [**dos-game-suite-8086**](https://github.com/antonijn/dos-game-suite-8086)

     A working DOS snake game with x86_16 mode 13h graphics.

     _Language: x86 assembly_

  - [**werk**](https://github.com/antonijn/werk)

    A (half-working) text-editor based on 1) piping text through external programs, and 2) structural navigation.

    _Language: C_
